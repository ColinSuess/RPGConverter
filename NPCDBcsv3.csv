If forced to attack he uses burning hands on a group of enemies (even if he catches another tiefling in the area, as he expects their fire resistance will protect them), fire bolt at wounded targets, and cause fear or hold person on weak-willed opponents. If he is visible and has a spare turn, he uses copycat to confuse opponents. If he wants reinforcements, he calls to the Hell dog in area 16, or moves to that area if that is a better tactical option.","If reduced to 10 hp and unable to heal himself, Palaveen tries to escape, using copycat if possible and his potion of disguise self to blend it with the human population of Westcrown.
